The PPG Industry Talk, organised under the course SECP 1513 – Technology Information and System, served as an industry-oriented session that connected academic learning with real-world applications. The talk highlighted how paint and coating technologies are developed and applied across multiple sectors, emphasising innovation, sustainability, and technological advancement.

PPG is a global company specialising in paints, coatings, and specialty materials, serving industries such as automotive, aerospace, construction, and consumer products. The session provided an overview of how these technologies are utilised to meet industrial demands and performance standards.

During the talk, it was explained that coatings serve purposes beyond aesthetics and play a crucial role in protection, durability, and sustainability. Coatings help protect surfaces from corrosion, environmental damage, and wear, making them essential in both industrial and everyday applications.

The speaker also highlighted PPG’s strong emphasis on technology and innovation, particularly its continuous investment in research and development (R&D). Through R&D, PPG develops advanced coating solutions with improved durability, enhanced colour retention, and greater environmental friendliness, demonstrating how innovation drives progress in the coatings industry.

Another key topic discussed was sustainability. PPG is committed to reducing environmental impact through the use of sustainable raw materials and energy-efficient manufacturing processes. Examples shared included water-based paints, recyclable packaging, and long-lasting coatings that reduce maintenance requirements and minimise environmental waste.

In addition, the session introduced various career opportunities within PPG and the broader coatings and chemical industries. These opportunities include roles in chemical engineering, materials science, research and development (R&D), quality control, production management, and technical sales. This exposure helped me understand how academic knowledge can be applied in real industrial environments.

In conclusion, the PPG Industry Talk was an informative and insightful experience that enhanced my understanding of the role of paints and coatings in safety, sustainability, and technological advancement. The session also motivated me to explore future career opportunities related to materials science, chemical technology, and industrial innovation.
